    <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>I am a programmer, software developer, and lifelong scholar and developer. My interests are in web applications,
                    full-stack and front-end
                    development, and design. I have a Bachelors of Science in computer science and I am an Oracle certified Java
                    developer. I enjoy designing,
                    creating, and turning my imagination into reality through programming. Outside of computer science, I am a
                    committed learner and use my free time
                    to learn as much as I can to become the most educated person possible. My favorite quote is "education is not
                    preparation for life; education
                    is life itself." When I'm not coding, you can likely find me pumping iron, reading about the world, learning a
                    new skill or language, thinking
                    about education, or planning my text travel trip!

                    I am currently working hard at American Express as a software engineer! Aside from programming and coding, I have done work
                    involving design and the arts, such as creating mockups and animations. Additionally, as one who enjoys learning and pursuing
                    knowledge, I also like to share and convey my knowledge with others. I have worked as a tutor for over 4 years across various
                    learning centers and schools.
